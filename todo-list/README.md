This is a basic todo-app that I build as a toy app in order to practice Ruby on Rails.


###**Installation**

This app uses Rails v5.2.3 and Ruby v2.5.3.

To run this app, install it by using ```git clone https://github.com/chiral-carbon/toy-app-rails.git```.

Then cd to the directory ```toy-app-rails/todo-list``` and run ```rails s``` OR ```rails server```.


###**Topics I hope to cover**

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions


You can use this as a layout and modify it to build your very own app. Happy learning!
