This is a basic todo-app that I build as a toy app in order to practice Ruby on Rails.

**Installation**
=================

This app uses Rails v5.2.3 and Ruby v2.5.3.

- To run this app, install it by typing into your terminal ```git clone https://github.com/chiral-carbon/toy-app-rails.git```

- Then change to the app directory by typing ```cd toy-app-rails/todo-list``` 

- Now inside the ```todo-list``` directory start the app by typing ```rails s``` OR ```rails server```

- Then run the app by typing ```localhost:3000/``` into your web browser.


**Concepts I hope to understand**
==================================

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions


You can use this as a layout and modify it to build your very own app. Happy learning!
